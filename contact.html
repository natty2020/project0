                <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. Of 
                    course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able to answer? He 
                    put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue 
                    to do so.</p>
                <p>The words hadn't flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks. He never imagined he'd find himself 
                    with writer's block, but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him. That blank screen taunting 
                    him day after day had started to play with his mind. He didn't understand why he couldn't even type a 
                    single word, just one to begin the process and build from there. And yet, he already knew that the 
                    eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining 
                    blank.</p>
